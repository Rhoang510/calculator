This is my calculator project from the Odin Project.

I had a lot of fun doing this project. Did a whole bunch of refactoring when inputing new functions. I tried to trim down the code as much as I could, and think this is the best I can come out with using what I've learned from the cirriculem and a whole bunch of googling.

This calculator has keyboard support, and just about everything is bug free from my extensive testing and rewriting my code. If there are any bugs at all, feel free to message me and I'll gladly be up to the challenge to fix them.

Esc = clear button
Backspace = delete button
Enter = equal button

The rest of the buttons should be straight forward.
